# Development Process Report

## Project Overview
- **Project Chosen**: HR Performance Management System
- **Technology Stack**: 
  - Backend: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Sequelize ORM, JWT Authentication
  - Frontend: React 18, Material-UI, React Router, React Query, React Hook Form
  - Security: Helmet, Rate Limiting, bcrypt, CORS
- **Development Timeline**: 
  - Backend Setup & Authentication: 2 hours
  - Database Models & API Development: 3 hours
  - Frontend Components & Pages: 4 hours
  - Performance Review System: 2 hours
  - Integration & Testing: 1 hour
  - **Total**: 12 hours

## AI Tool Usage Summary
- **AWS Q Developer**: 
  - Usage: Primary development assistant for code generation, debugging, and architecture decisions
  - Effectiveness Rating: 9/10
  - Key Contributions: Complete CRUD operations, authentication system, performance review scoring logic
  
- **GitHub Copilot**: Not used in this project
- **Cursor**: Not used in this project

## Architecture Decisions
- **Database Design**: 
  - PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM for robust relational data management
  - User roles (Admin, HR, Manager, Employee) with role-based access control
  - Performance reviews with weighted scoring system (6 metrics)
  - AI Input: Suggested enum constraints and indexing strategies

- **API Architecture**: 
  - RESTful API design with Express.js
  - JWT-based authentication with middleware protection
  - Role-based authorization for different endpoints
  - AI Guidance: Recommended security middleware and error handling patterns

- **Frontend Architecture**: 
  - React functional components with hooks
  - Material-UI for consistent design system
  - Context API for authentication state management
  - React Query for efficient data fetching and caching

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Technical Challenges**: 
  1. **Complex Performance Review Scoring**: Implemented weighted scoring system with 6 metrics
     - AI Solution: Generated calculation logic and rating categories
  2. **Role-based Data Filtering**: Employees should only see their own reviews
     - AI Solution: Dynamic where clauses based on user role
  3. **Authentication Token Management**: Consistent token handling across components
     - AI Solution: Centralized token storage and header configuration

- **AI Limitations**: 
  - Required manual refinement of database enum values
  - Needed custom business logic for performance scoring criteria
  - Manual integration of frontend and backend authentication flow

- **Breakthrough Moments**: 
  - AI-generated complete CRUD operations with proper error handling
  - Automated creation of responsive Material-UI components
  - Instant generation of role-based access control middleware
